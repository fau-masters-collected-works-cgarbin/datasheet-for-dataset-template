The questions in this section are primarily intended to encourage dataset creators
to clearly articulate their reasons for creating the dataset and to promote transparency
about funding interests.

## Motivation

### For what purpose was the dataset created? 

_Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled?
Please provide a description._

### Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?

### Who funded the creation of the dataset? 

_If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant
name and number._

### Any other comments?

## Composition

### What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?

_Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description._

### How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?

### Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?

_If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative
of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this
representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set,
please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because
instances were withheld or unavailable)._

### What data does each instance consist of? 

_“Raw” data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
provide a description._

### Is there a label or target associated with each instance?

_If so, please provide a description._

### Is any information missing from individual instances?

_If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g.,
because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information,
but might include, e.g., redacted text._

### Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)?

_If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit._

### Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)?

_If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them._

### Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?

_If so, please provide a description._

### Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)?

_If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will
exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the
complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed at the time the
dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with
any of the external resources that might apply to a future user? Please provide descriptions
of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other
access points, as appropriate._

### Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?

_If so, please provide a description._

### Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?

_If so, please describe why._

### Does the dataset relate to people? 

_If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section._

### Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender)?

_If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of
their respective distributions within the dataset._

### Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset?

_If so, please describe how._

### Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (e.g., data that reveals racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)?

_If so, please provide a description._
